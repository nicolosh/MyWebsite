# MyWebsite
My personal website (and technical life)

## Method 1 (Simple)

   - **Step 1**: Create a repository  as follows:  
       - Go to https://github.com  
       - Click on **New** to create a new repo    
       - Give it a name (i.e. myWebsite)  
       - Set if the repository needs to be public or private  
       - (Optional) Add a README.md file  

   - **Step 2**: Add an index.html file:  
       - You can do it from your browser or via git.  
       - Example:  
   
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Welcome!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1> Hello from my website on GitHub Pages!</h1>
  <p> This is a static website hosted on GitHub.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
